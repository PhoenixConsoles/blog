# How to Contribute

### Thank you so much for visiting this page! This project can't come to fruition without *YOU*!

**Preserving your hardware[link needed] and keeping your KV unbanned[link needed] are two great ways to ensure the longevity of the Xbox 360 modding scene, as the hardware is no longer produced[citation needed].**



# Important Information

### TRANSLATIONS ARE WELCOME

We use an automated system to generate various languages of pages for the wiki based off the English versions we create, as we believe open source information should be accessible. However, these pages must go through a review process to confirm that they are accurate and edited as needed to become `verified pages`, which are verified to provide accurate information via our review processes.

### Opening issues can help us help others!

We need to gather data from all sorts of categories. Please check out the issue templates available to discover the many ways *anyone* can help!

## How do we(and you) make sure everything is accurate, verifiable, and still openly editable? Our Review Processes:

### Our Teams

Our hierarchy includes:

Our Administration team, responsible for managing the repository's core functionality and other teams.

Our Research team, responsible for researching the topics of the wiki and adding, changing, and citing information.

Our Review team, responsible for reviewing issues and pull requests to verify information and are the team that handles the review processes. This is the team that expedites `priority` and `stale` issues.

Our Moderation team, responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct[LINK NEEDED], verifying proper assignment of labels, projects, and milestones to issues and pull requests, and handling basic issue system maintenance.

Our teams are essential to the enforcement of this document and maintenance of this wiki and consist of mostly volunteers, and *you* can help, too! Just apply using the appropriate issue template.[LINK NEEDED]

### The issue system

The issue system is a publicly available ticket system. You can browse our issue templates to learn more about what you can do with the issue system.[LINK NEEDED]  Issue labels are provided for categorization of issues and serve the purpose of making the issue system searchable and clean, as well as providing a method to automate some aspects of issue system maintenance. Any open issues which have not had activity within the last 30 days will be automatically marked `stale` and will be processed through our review team. Duplicate issues are labeled, a comment is added referencing the original issue thread, and closed to prevent clutter. Issues which do not provide enough information or are not following the appropriate template will be marked `needinfo` which indicates that the issue requires adjustment by the issue creator to be processed. Issues that are `stale` and `need info` will be closed to prevent clutter.

### The citation system

The citation system we use is meant to ensure longevity of accessibility to the information in a verifiable format. Due to size constraints, we must rely on archive.org for archiving citations. We also provide the original link for ease of access to potentially updated information, as the archive.org link is to reflect the time of access or the last time which the page was functionally accessible. If a page becomes entirely inaccessible, if must be marked with `[DEAD LINK]` in the wiki and a issue must be opened for it. Any claims or information needing a citation must be marked` [CITATION NEEDED]` to indicate a citation is needed(until all citations are added it cannot become a verified page) or `[#]`(indicating the relevant citation in the `References` section at the bottom of the page). All citations must be in MLA format. To learn about MLA format click here.[LINK NEEDED] Information that is relevant to a page but is outside the scope of this wiki must be linked directly to a relevant source on that topic, with archive.org links being used in lieu of a direct link wherever a direct link is dead and a equivalent replacement is unavailable.

### The verified pages system

Verified pages are pages that have passed review, which consists of verifying the information & citations provided, ensuring it is updated with any new evidence or information discovered over time, and by ensuring access to verifiable, accurate data as applicable and possible. Disputed or Unproven claims MUST be notated with [DISPUTED]/[UNPROVEN], respectively, and any page with unresolved disputed or unproven claims cannot be verified until they are resolved. Any issues regarding or affecting a verified page are to be marked `priority`. Feel free to submit information through our issues system.[LINK NEEDED].

### The pull request system

You are able to fork, edit, and submit a pull request through Github to remove, change, or add information and submit those changes to our review team. Pull requests must be associated with a relevant issue. If an issue does not exist that is relevant to your pull request, create one and then submit the pull request with the appropriate issue linked. Learn more about pull requests here.[LINK NEEDED]

### Github Actions

Github Actions are used to automate deployment of updates to the website as well as handle various other automated tasks, such as helping maintain the issue system. You can learn more about Github Actions here.[LINK NEEDED]

### The Project System

We use Projects to organize issues into various review and resolution streams. These projects represent the short- and long-term goals of the wiki and community. Projects are assigned to issues by our moderation team. You can learn more about Github Projects here.[LINK NEEDED]

### The Milestone System

We use Milestones to categorize our goals and relevant issues to successfully completing those goals. Milestones serve to provide another layer of issue tracking and categorization as well as providing deadline setting for our goals. Any milestones with deadlines within 30 days are to have their issues marked `priority`.

### The Originality Pledge

All contributions must be original works(even if they are based off the research or work of others, so long as they are appropriately credited and cited) except for where the work is licensed identically to the wiki and the licensing requirements are met to ensure legality of the website, wiki, repository, and it's contents.

## Page Structure

The page format used is intended to be simple, easily readable and understandable, and searchable. The page structure consists of: 

Root index - this is the front page of the wiki and contains links to all the categories indexes and some important pages.

Category index - these are the front pages of the various categories of topics the wiki contains and contain links to their subcategory indexes and important pages related to the category.

Tutorial Pages - these pages contain information on *how* to do something. Any guides or instructions are tutorial pages.

Informational Page - these pages contain information *about* something. Any pages describing something in an informative context are informational pages.

Wiki pages - these pages contain information about the wiki, repository, and website. This page is an example of a wiki page.

## Page Layout

**ALL** pages must contain a link to the license[LINK NEEDED], the repository page[LINK NEEDED], the contribution page[LINK NEEDED], and the code of conduct[LINK NEEDED] at the footer of the page. These are automatically added when building the site and adding them manually is not needed. All pages must also include a H1 header of the page title followed by an optional H3 subtitle and organized in a readable, searchable manner into H2 subheaders and H3 sub-subheaders, with H4 and H5 used as needed to create lower level headers. All embedded or linked images must be contained in the `media` folder. 

### Root Index

This page must contain links to all of the top-level category index pages and links to important pages in the wiki.

### Category Index

This page must contain links to all of it's sub-category index pages and links to important pages in the category/subcategory. These can be infinitely recursive as necessary(i.e. software index > app index > Netflix page would be navigated to by clicking the software link on the root index, then the Netflix link on the app index page.)

### Tutorial Pages

These pages must contain citations for all claims and information within, as well as links to any relevant information, tutorials, tools, etc. Tutorials must include sections describing equipment and software needed to follow the tutorial, warnings relevant to the tutorial, and recommendations for further reading. They must also contain a Credits section at the bottom, crediting those who were involved in the research and creation of the tutorial. Credits are not required where linked page(s) credit them for the same work(i.e. you DO have to credit them for designing hardware on the hardware's page, but DO NOT have to credit them in the tutorial page if they are already credited on the appropriate page for the same work AND that page is linked appropriately in the tutorial's page.)

### Informational Pages

These pages must contain citations for all claims and information within, as well as links to any relevant information, tutorials, tools, etc. They must also contain a Credits section at the bottom, crediting those who were involved in the research and creation of the page topic, as well as any major contributors to reverse engineering or development. Credits are not required where linked page(s) credit them for the same work(i.e. you DO have to credit them for designing hardware on the hardware's page, but DO NOT have to credit them in the informational page if they are already credited on the appropriate page for the same work AND that page is linked appropriately in the informational page.)

### Wiki Pages

Wiki pages must be contained on the root of the repository and accessible from the root index. These pages are informational pages about the wiki itself, files and folders used for administration of the wiki, website, and repository, and are protected, requiring extra review to ensure validity and approve changes.

## File Structure

### Structure may be built upon, but must be documented here, all file and folder names MUST BE all *lowercase*, *alphanumeric*, and *written in English*, and be sensible.

root - This holds all primary category folders and base pages for the wiki and repository.

media - For all images. This folder is categorized and must be categorized in a manner that makes sense and the information about the structure must be added here.

media>consoles - All external images of fully assembled consoles belong in here with naming convention of `phat/slim/e`-`le/dev/re/cus`-`descriptive name`-`pos`. 

`le`: limited edition, `dev`: development console, `re`: retail console, `cus`: custom console, `descriptive name`: keep it short but identifiable, `pos`: small descriptor indicating the position from which the image was taken.

guides - This is where all guides and tutorials go. 

guides>custom - This is where all guides about customization(such as aesthetic modifications like leds, case mods, etc.) belong.

guides>dev - This is where all guides about developing hardware, software, or modifications for the Xbox 360 or any of it's relevant components go.

guides>mod - This is where all guides for the Ultimate Mod Guide will go(such as running unsigned code, backing up games, modding games, dumping the nand, identifying your console hardware, )

guides>repair - This is where all guides about repairing, preserving, or
